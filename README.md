# 💡 Data Science Electives: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Welcome to our Data Science Project for our CpE Elective about Machine Learning! 🎓

## 📘 About the Project

This prototype explores the use of machine learning—specifically, the **XGBoost** algorithm—for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a real-world, highly imbalanced dataset, we aim to build and evaluate a classification model that helps flag potential frauds based on transaction features.

Our project covers:

- 📊 Data cleaning and exploration
- 🤖 Model training and evaluation using XGBoost
- 📈 Visualization of key performance metrics
- 🛠 A Streamlit-based interactive prototype
- 💬 A Google Colab version for demonstration and reproducibility

## 🚀 Goal

Our goal is to apply real-world machine learning techniques in a compact but effective prototype that demonstrates how data science can assist in fraud detection—an important use case in financial technology.
